This function loads a pre-trained machine learning model and uses it to predict the priority of a given bug. 
The model would need to be trained on a large dataset of bugs and their corresponding priority labels.


def BPA(bug):
    trained_model = load_model('bug_priority_model')
    priority = trained_model.predict(bug)
    return priority
